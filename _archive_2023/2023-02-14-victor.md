Bumblebee is the yellow four-legged robot very reminiscent of another (much more expensive and bigger) yellow four-legged robot.  Instead of feet I put acrylic disks to help it skate and/or roll across the ice.

Sting is the police robot with tracked wheels and red and blue flashing lights.  It can pursue bad robots and turn in place.

The unnamed sphere robot is a spherical robot that rolls on the ice.  It is unique in that it does not have an up side, a right side, a left side, or a down side.  It can also spin in place if it has no traction on the ice (darn frictionless planes!).
