## About the Humanoids
The interactive Robot humanoid comedy show has been delighting the Bay Area with their jokes for 8 years! It started with a 12-year-old's summer goal of building an inMoov open-source robot.  The robot family has expanded to 3 humanoids laughing and entertaining audiences. Explore hands on electronics, software, and 3D printing working together, while picking your comedy preferences!
