## Beyoncé Baes

The “Beyoncé Baes”, led by Ashanté Wheatley (“Coach A/Coach Awesome”) are an adult production team currently in their second iteration after their first showing at Yerba Buena Ice Skating Center’s Annual “Shamrock Skate” an ISI and Open Competition, in 2023. The Baes are comprised of adult skaters in their 20’s, 30’s, and 40’s who are new to the art of figure skating (2 years or less). They are passionate, diverse, and a truly inspirational group of adults who have unlocked a new joy in performance and self-expression. Whether lack-of-opportunity as kids or simply experiencing a new-found hobby as adults, they are a prime example that it’s never too late to learn and grow . . . and of course skate to the upbeat and inclusive music stylings of Beyoncé!
