## Gatorade

A robot designed to play the 2023 FIRST game. We will not be using its intake or other features to ensure our robot does not get wet and damaged. 

## Team 766

We are Team 766, M-A Bears, from Menlo-Atherton High school. We will be driving our robot on ice for the first time! 

Our team enjoys doing outreach at events like Robots on Ice, including (STEM) fairs, visiting our local middle and elementary schools, and hosting our training prgram for new members (rookies), Mechanical M-Ayhem. We group rookies together and pair them with a veteran member to guide them into building a 18" by 18" robot that plays against other rookie teams (including other FRC teams) after around 12 weeks. We hope to inspire the next generation in pursuing STEM.
