After you've spent the day hanging out by the rink with robots, join us at [Off the Rails Brewing Co](https://www.offtherailsbrewing.com
) at 111 S Murphy Avenue for the afterparty, a Bots & Beer meetup.

We'll hang out and talk about the day, what's happening in robotics in general around the bay and beyond. Any topic in robotics is welcome!

Your wristband for the event will get you a discounted drink. And if you purchase the [Bots & Beer ticket](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/robots-on-ice-2021-tickets-191480642757) we'll be buying some pitchers.

Off the Rails also offers hot beverages and food in case you want to warm up too.

And if you stick around at 6:30 there will be live jazz music on the back patio by Evelyn and Friends. [More info on their website](https://www.offtherailsbrewing.com/events)
