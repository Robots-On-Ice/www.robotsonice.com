## Dagger 

Quadruped robot built with brushless motors and compliant actuators. Complete design from motor controllers, mechanical design, kinematics by me. There robot also has no brains on-board. Only power distribution, position commands are sent wirelessly to each actuator. Here's my blog about it: https://www.dagor.dev/blog/quadruped-robot
