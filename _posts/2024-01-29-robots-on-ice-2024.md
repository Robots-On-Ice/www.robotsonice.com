<h3>When: April 21st, 2024</h3>

<h3>Where: <a href="https://www.skatebowl.com">Yerba Buena Ice Skating & Bowling Center in San Francisco</a></h3>

🤖Bring out your bots, bring out your bot skating attire, come to cheer on our bots & skaters, and see you there on April 21st in the afternoon at Yerba Buena Ice Skating & Bowling Center in San Francisco!

<br><br>


⛸️We are enthusiastic about this year's ice skating performance lineup with 2014 Olympic Team Member Polina Edmunds, 2x USFS Gold Medalist & AR/VR Developer Josette Seitz (we hear she'll be skating with 3 different AR headsets!), the Robot Trio ladies, and more to be announced!

<br><br>


🧊 On the ice in robot play and robot races, be sure to check out Sawppy x2, Rover, Bittle, Boston Dynamics' Spot, and of course RC car races!

<br><br>

💃In the last third of the event, be sure to check out our first ever TECH-FASHION show which will include family-friendly glow-up designs by local makers and engineers!

<br><br>


👩‍💻And if that's not enough, hang out around the ice for very fun networking with fellow roboticists and those interested in exploring robotics!

<br><br>


Be sure to book early to ensure you can get a spot for you and your friends or family! 👪 And check out our family deals and our first ever Robots on Ice beanies!
