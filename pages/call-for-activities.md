The Silicon Valley Ice Skating Association is hosting its third Robots on Ice event on February 26, 2023. This holiday season the Palo Alto Winterlodge will be the exciting host of Silicon Valley Ice Skating Association’s (sv-isa.org) next instance of Robots on Ice. The inaugural event was held in January 2020, where we helped build excitement around robotics and had a great time 


## Event Goal:

Have fun exploring low friction environments with robots. 

### Call for Robots

We are looking for roboticists to join us at [Winterlodge](https://winterlodge.com/) to show off their robots. 

The goal is to have fun and highlight some of the challenges of the low friction environment as well as entertain the spectators who are watching. Robotic performances or demonstrations can also be considered if they will be of interest to attendees to watch. 

There will be space near the ice surface where robots can be showcased when they’re not on the ice. 

If you have a creative idea that doesn’t fit into any of these categories please reach out to us and we can work with you to see if we can make it work for the event.


If you’d like to bring a robot please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfC0Xqd97vw_ePcQR9Ab8LeUJTCHd2kPGvdM5a0p_zp9qf7EQ/viewform?usp=sf_link).
