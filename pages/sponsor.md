title: Sponsor Robots On Ice
---

# Mission and Goal

Robots on Ice will boldly explore frontiers of technology including robotics, drones, and electronic arts. This event brings together global innovators, leaders, partners, explorers, and pioneers of all ages and skill levels, to explore the challenging low-friction surface of an ice rink facility. We are inviting teams of engineering inventors to share the spirit of innovation. Specifically their creations should excel in system design, artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotics, and design thinking to bring the Tech community to Silicon Valley ice rinks.

Our goal is to inspire engineers of all ages and abilities to think outside typical R&D experimentation and environments to accelerate robotics, and transcend extreme circumstances. We will do this by providing a platform to pioneer and disrupt technology in an innovative ice rink facility.

We are looking for companies who can help us make this vision happen.

# Sponsorship and Marketing Opportunities

The Robots on Ice is a unique event that unifies tech with the world of ice. You can be part of this historic event if you consider yourself one of the following:
 * You make an ideal sponsor if you would like to hop aboard and be a pioneer on the frontier of the technology industry.
 * You or your organization have one or more robot and/or novel technology which you would like to enter into one or more of our events. Proposals for additional activities or challenges are also welcome.
